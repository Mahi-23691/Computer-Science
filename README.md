This is a simple Repository about the projects I learn and make in my school as I progress through year 11 in BHS.

For my Flask Program there are two programs. One is suited for CLI named "rich_people.py" and the other one is made Flask and HTML and CSS named "app.py" which is for GUI. If you are my teacher and want to grade my SQL Assessment then I request you to run the Flask server and then check the website and grading me on that; Thank you in advance. I have also added a docstring in those file for further clarification.
